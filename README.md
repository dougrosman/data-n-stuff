##### A collection of links and ideas to accompany a lecture about Big Data/machine learning/computational technology/Art/etc.

### 0. Notes
* Two (?) ways of thinking about surveillance/data capture/predictive modeling
    * Practical/Actionable
    * Personal/Psychological
* The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: "Behavioral Exhaust"
* It's easier to capture and store ALL your data than it is to determine and capture only what is considered "useful." (especially since what might not be useful now may someday become useful)*

* "Technology cannot identify someone’s sexual orientation. What their technology can recognize is a pattern that found a small subset of out, white gay and lesbian people on dating sites who look similar. Those two findings should not be conflated,” Jim Halloran, GLAAD’s chief digital officer, wrote in a statement claiming the paper could cause harm exposing methods to target gay people."
