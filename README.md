##### A collection of links and ideas to accompany a lecture about Big Data/machine learning/computational technology/Art/etc. This is a growing list!

### 0. Notes
* Two (?) ways of thinking about surveillance/data capture/predictive modeling
    * Practical/Actionable (how does the availability of your data make you a target of government, corporate, or "other" action?)
    * Personal/Psychological (how do you incorporate an AI's understanding of "you" into your own self-understanding?)
* [The Age of Surveillance Capitalism-Shoshana Zuboff](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26195941-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism): "Behavioral Exhaust"/Behavioral Surplus
* Surveillance Capitalism is:
1. A new economic order that claims human experience as free raw material for hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction, and sales; 2. A parasitic economic logic in which the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new global architecture of behavioral modification; 3. A rogue mutation of capitalism marked by concentrations of wealth, knowledge, and power unprecedented in human history; 4. The foundational framework of a surveillance economy; 5. As significant a threat to human nature in the twenty-first century as industrial capitalism was to the natural world in the nineteenth and twentieth; 6. The origin of a new instrumentarian power that asserts dominance over society and presents startling challenges to market democracy; 7. A movement that aims to impose a new collective order based on total certainty; 8. An expropriation of critical human rights that is best understood as a coup from above: an overthrow of the people’s sovereignty.
* It's easier to capture and store ALL your data than it is to determine and capture only what is considered "useful." (especially since what might not be useful now may someday become useful)
* We can be connected and compared to each other in ways that defy human language.
