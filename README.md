## Data 'n' Stuff // Doug Rosman

##### A collection of links and ideas to accompany a lecture about Big Data/machine learning/computational technology/Art/etc. This is a growing list!

### 0. Notes
* Two (?) ways of thinking about surveillance/data capture/predictive modeling
    * Practical/Actionable (how does the availability of your data make you a target of government, corporate, or "other" action?)
    * Personal/Psychological (how do you incorporate an AI's understanding of "you" into your own self-understanding?)
* The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: "Behavioral Exhaust"
* It's easier to capture and store ALL your data than it is to determine and capture only what is considered "useful." (especially since what might not be useful now may someday become useful)
